PCL Hello world!
----------------
Some basic C++ (C++11, even) programs that should be compilable using PCL.

The `qt_visualizer` project wants to have the `opaque` sample data set unpacked in the directory `sample_data/opaque`. The `opaque` data set (~300 MB) can currently be obtained at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointclouds/files/PCD%20datasets/Toyota%20%28TOCS%20%231%29/glasses_opaque.zip/download> (there are many references that say that these sample data sets should be available at <http://svn.pointclouds.org/data/Toyota>, but that SVN repository does not seem to be online).
